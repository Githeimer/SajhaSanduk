  - **UI**: Beautifully designed UI components with [Shadcn UI](https://github.com/shadcn/ui).
  - **Styling**: Responsive and flexible styles with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
  - **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for database management and [Supabase](https://supabase.io) for backend-as-a-service.
